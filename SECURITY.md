### Security Best Practices

When deploying:

```python
# ✅ DO THIS
admin = ShadcnAdmin(
    app,
    engine=engine,
    secret_key=os.getenv("ADMIN_SECRET"),  # From environment
    # Generate with: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
)

# ❌ DON'T DO THIS
admin = ShadcnAdmin(
    app,
    engine=engine,
    secret_key="my-weak-secret"  # Hardcoded, weak
)
```

**Additional Recommendations:**
- Use HTTPS in production
- Keep dependencies updated
- Enable audit logging
- Review RBAC permissions regularly
- Use strong secret keys (32+ characters)
- Set secure session cookie flags
